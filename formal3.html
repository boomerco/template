			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Human biology at Michigan State University is taken through the College of Natural Science. This discipline is designed to expand studentsâ€™ knowledge in all areas of biology and prepare the students for careers in the biology field and for students who want to further their education. By choosing this discipline, however, does not prepare students for teaching. It is an undergraduate degree and students need at least 120 credits to graduate. To graduate students need to fulfill university, college, and major requirements. The university requirements are the same as all Michigan State University students. These requirements include tier I writing, mathematics, IAH (both under or equal to 210 level and 211 or higher level), ISS (200 level and 300 level), ISB, and ISP. The College of Natural Science requires students to take biology, chemistry, and physics. This discipline has a variety of required courses that require the student to be a part of every aspect of the science genre. They need to take courses in the human physiology, biochemistry, genetics, laboratory experiences, anatomy, immunology, capstone, and residency. This degree requires tough academic courses. The residency for this major must come from work at Michigan State through classes and coursework. The electives for this major are embedded in the required courses. Of the elective/ required courses students are able to choose from a variety of classes that suite their personal interest or interested field of study. The capstone experience that was mentioned earlier allows students to take part in research taking place at Michigan State University. Students do research with a professor on campus and present their data at the end of the year. This helps prepare students for lab work and show future employers what students have found in their research. Students may pick any field to do research in. Examples of research areas to study in are oncology, genetics, etc. For students going into medical school, this allows them to include research to their medical school application. Other job opportunities include research, gene mapping, forensic studies, and many other opportunities.</p>
