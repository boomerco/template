		<h1>Remix Project</h1>
		<p>I am sending this memorandum to you to assess our group remix project. We did our documentary on the use of Photoshop on people and how it affects society. Our group chose this because Sydney and I had wrote on this topic for our cultural analysis paper. Having two of us that had written about this issue, our group decided to go into further detail about this issue.</p>
		<p>This issue was easily broken into sections, which made composing the documentary easy. We were able to break it up into: how to Photoshop, how easy it is to Photoshop, and effects on society.   We had trouble figuring out what order to place the video in and where to place the interviews. The audience’s role is to take the information in the video and realize that no one is truly perfect and beauty is not what the media has us believe.</p>
		<p>We chose this topic because two people in the group, Sydney and I, had written our cultural analysis project on this topic and wanted to go into more detail about it. The most challenging part was editing the video.  This was the hardest part because we had to choose what was more important to the video and what was a not as important and editing clip was challenging at times as well. We did take a systematic approach. We started with the topic, picked what we wanted to develop within the topic, and then decided who was going to focus where. </p>
		<p>The pictures and videos were the most beneficial to our research. The images are proof that this is occurring in magazines everywhere. The videos show how real the issue is. Showing how easy it is to completely change someone’s appearance and hearing from a person with an eating disorder makes the research that more real. The interviews helped the project but as far as research goes, they didn’t prove anything the photos and videos didn’t already accomplish. </p>
<p>Our group worked really well together. There was something there for everybody to do and something everyone was good at. The only negative would be that Zac only showed up to one meeting and didn’t really have a lot of input nor did he put a lot of effort in, but he didn’t hurt the group. Working in a group was fruitful. It allowed us all to come together and all put a bit of our own taste into one video that really flowed well.</p>
<p>The most affective aspect of our project would be the eating disorders part. It really brought up what people will do in order to look “beautiful”. It sends a strong message that images edited affect people in a negative way. It makes the issue real and shows the consequences of producing these images. We made our design decisions based on what made the video more dramatic to get the point across. We put it in order from altered images to the effects of these images to show how it is done before overwhelming the audience with the affects.</p>
