		<p>The purpose of this video was to make the viewer aware of how hurtful people are towards people who are gay and how your actions affect others. It also brings up the awareness of suicide among people who are gay and that suicide is not the answer. The video does tell the viewer that it does get better.</p>
<p>This video uses attempts to achieve its purpose by using a real life example of how others affected a man that was gay. How people treated him made "Uncle Ronnie" feels alone. His father did not support him which made him feel alone. It ended up driving Uncle Ronnie to suicide. The author of the letter is very similar to Uncle Ronnie. He is gay, divorced with children, has a parent who doesn’t understand him, and feels alone. Unlike Uncle Ronnie, he is not driven to suicide. The author is hurt and angry that Uncle Ronnie to his life. He tells of all the pain that was left behind from what Uncle Ronnie did.</p>
<p>The structure of the video uses poetry, letter, and pathos to convey the message. The author recites a poem at the beginning that directly relates to the topic. It engages the viewer to what he has to say. By formatting his speech in the form of a letter, it gives the viewer a personal connection to focus on. Having him talk about his own uncle who was in the same situation as him uses pathos. It gives an emotional connection that means a lot to the author. All of his anger and pain are brought out while he is reading the letter. It shows the pain of how being treated differently for who you love.</p>
<p>This will help me revise my Lived Experience project by showing how to add emotion to convey my purpose.  By adding how you feel engages the viewer’s emotional response and helps them see your view.</p>

<p>The people targeted in this video are video gamers who are obsessed with video games. It makes fun of people who do nothing but play video games.</p>
<p>The social issue is people are too invested with video games. They are willing to give up their life to play games. These people are willing to give up everything to play the game. Nothing is more important than their gaming. People give up their careers to spend time gaming, they do not take care of their health, they give up on their social life outside of the game, etc.</p> 
<p>The video’s creators’ show that there are people out there who are willing to give up their lives for gaming. They use humor and extreme cases to get the point across, but it is true. There are people out there like this. It is humorous, but it does get the point across that there are risks to people who are too invested in gaming. They show the man with “no life” who is obese and doesn’t eat properly. They show that it is dangerous by showing how the kids become obese, get acne, get carpal tunnel from the game, and cannot take a break for anything. The kids give up there life for a game. They neglect their need for sleep and school as well. It shows all the other kids outside for recess, but they are in the computer lab busy playing the game. They are doing all of this just to beat another player.  They become addicted and once they beat the player who was killing everyone, they do not know what to do other than play the game.</p>

<p>The imagery of Detroit in the advertisement for the Chrysler 200 shows how strong the city is. It shows all of the buildings standing tall. It also uses the steel fist to show the strength of the city and how it isn’t what people believe. It also shows the beautiful side of the city as well. It shows the art work of sculptures around the city. The sculptures are white and gold and show the luxury side of Detroit. They show a woman figure skating in a park to help emphasize beauty. </p>
<p>By including Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself” the advertisement shows what good comes from the city. Eminem started off as a poor boy in Detroit and worked his way up into being a very successful rapper. He shows that beautiful things come from the city and how it cannot be compared to any other city in the United States. It shows how good things do come for Detroit. Using Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself” shows that if you lose yourself in the true beauty in the city, you can see past the ugly stories written about Detroit. </p>
<p>Using the slogan “Imported from Detroit” is using almost a humorous. Its showing that even though the car is coming from Detroit it is still luxury. Usually luxury cars are associated with car companies from overseas. Therefore, the standard luxury cars are imported. Chrysler is saying that people don’t need to import from other companies, they can use American car companies for luxury cars. </p>
