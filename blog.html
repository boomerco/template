		<p>The purpose of this video was to make the viewer aware of how hurtful people are towards people who are gay and how your actions affect others. It also brings up the awareness of suicide among people who are gay and that suicide is not the answer. The video does tell the viewer that it does get better.</p>
<p>This video uses attempts to achieve its purpose by using a real life example of how others affected a man that was gay. How people treated him made "Uncle Ronnie" feels alone. His father did not support him which made him feel alone. It ended up driving Uncle Ronnie to suicide. The author of the letter is very similar to Uncle Ronnie. He is gay, divorced with children, has a parent who doesn’t understand him, and feels alone. Unlike Uncle Ronnie, he is not driven to suicide. The author is hurt and angry that Uncle Ronnie to his life. He tells of all the pain that was left behind from what Uncle Ronnie did.</p>
<p>The structure of the video uses poetry, letter, and pathos to convey the message. The author recites a poem at the beginning that directly relates to the topic. It engages the viewer to what he has to say. By formatting his speech in the form of a letter, it gives the viewer a personal connection to focus on. Having him talk about his own uncle who was in the same situation as him uses pathos. It gives an emotional connection that means a lot to the author. All of his anger and pain are brought out while he is reading the letter. It shows the pain of how being treated differently for who you love.</p>
<p>This will help me revise my Lived Experience project by showing how to add emotion to convey my purpose.  By adding how you feel engages the viewer’s emotional response and helps them see your view.</p>

<p>The people targeted in this video are video gamers who are obsessed with video games. It makes fun of people who do nothing but play video games.</p>
<p>The social issue is people are too invested with video games. They are willing to give up their life to play games. These people are willing to give up everything to play the game. Nothing is more important than their gaming. People give up their careers to spend time gaming, they do not take care of their health, they give up on their social life outside of the game, etc.</p> 
<p>The video’s creators’ show that there are people out there who are willing to give up their lives for gaming. They use humor and extreme cases to get the point across, but it is true. There are people out there like this. It is humorous, but it does get the point across that there are risks to people who are too invested in gaming. They show the man with “no life” who is obese and doesn’t eat properly. They show that it is dangerous by showing how the kids become obese, get acne, get carpal tunnel from the game, and cannot take a break for anything. The kids give up there life for a game. They neglect their need for sleep and school as well. It shows all the other kids outside for recess, but they are in the computer lab busy playing the game. They are doing all of this just to beat another player.  They become addicted and once they beat the player who was killing everyone, they do not know what to do other than play the game.</p>

<p>The imagery of Detroit in the advertisement for the Chrysler 200 shows how strong the city is. It shows all of the buildings standing tall. It also uses the steel fist to show the strength of the city and how it isn’t what people believe. It also shows the beautiful side of the city as well. It shows the art work of sculptures around the city. The sculptures are white and gold and show the luxury side of Detroit. They show a woman figure skating in a park to help emphasize beauty. </p>
<p>By including Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself” the advertisement shows what good comes from the city. Eminem started off as a poor boy in Detroit and worked his way up into being a very successful rapper. He shows that beautiful things come from the city and how it cannot be compared to any other city in the United States. It shows how good things do come for Detroit. Using Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself” shows that if you lose yourself in the true beauty in the city, you can see past the ugly stories written about Detroit. </p>
<p>Using the slogan “Imported from Detroit” is using almost a humorous. Its showing that even though the car is coming from Detroit it is still luxury. Usually luxury cars are associated with car companies from overseas. Therefore, the standard luxury cars are imported. Chrysler is saying that people don’t need to import from other companies, they can use American car companies for luxury cars. </p>

<p>Our first project was our “Lived Experiences” paper. For this paper we had to talk about the major we want to go into at Michigan State and what technology has influenced us in that decision. You had to explain the technology and how it relates to the major you are in. We also had to talk about what we wanted to do as a career with that degree and what we were required to do in that career. My major is genomics and molecular genetics. With this major I want to work in a crime lab. I had to think of what technology influenced me to pick my major. This was hard for me to think of. I finally remembered doing a lab in A.P. biology. In that lab we had to cut bacterial DNA and DNA sequence several different genomes and match the unknown DNA with a known. I remember loving DNA sequencing with gel electrophoresis. Working with the DNA showed me that I wanted to do that as a career. Before that lab, I wanted to do something in the medical field and I also loved the criminal justice field. I did not know the two could be connected, but that lab showed me they could. My dad was a huge inspiration for me. He was a cop in Florida and then decided he wanted to be a firefighter/ paramedic. He was in the criminal justice and medical profession. I wanted to be able to do both instead of choosing one like he did. This paper was a bit challenging, but also fun to learn more about your major.</p>

<p>The second project we did was the “Cultural Analysis” paper. We had to individually choose a problem in society and write about it. For me, this was hard. There are a lot of societal problems and I did not know which one to pick. I happened to go on yahoo and see an advertisement for some clothing company. The woman modeling was obviously Photoshopped. That was how I decided to write about the use of Photoshop in the media and how it affects society. I talked about how when you edit the appearance of someone, it is not them anymore it is a completely new and fake person. The models we see in the media do not actually look like the images produced. By editing these photos, it changes societies view on beauty and gives it a fake standard. It causes women to want to look like the models they see. Some women will do anything to look like the women they see in the media. It causes women to have eating disorders, participate in extreme exercise, and plastic surgery. They go through that to be what society has labeled as “beauty”.  Some men will do the same thing in order to be more “attractive” to women. It also gives both sexes a false reality on what the other should look like. It creates unrealistic standards. Once I got started on this paper, I found it got easier to write. It was not very hard to find images that had the “before and after” effects of Photoshop. My example was Jennifer Lawrence in GQ magazine. The before images were leaked on the web. It showed how much they changed her when she was beautiful without it. This project was fun and interesting to write about.</p>

<p>The third project we did was the “Formal Research” project. This project I struggled with a lot. Some of the problem was that I was traveling without internet because of rowing and the other was finding people to interview. I chose to do my project on the human biology discipline with the intention of perusing a degree in the medical field.  I found all the requirements for this major and researched the classes. I spent a lot of time researching this major. It was hard to find a lot of information done by the major, so I looked into information about career tracks taken by the major. Medical school and becoming a doctor was the main direction students with this degree went with. I looked into becoming a doctor and articles published by doctors that were interesting. I interviewed Dr. Hessler who teaches at Michigan State and he talked about how writing was an important part of being a doctor and how lucky students are in today’s society that they have a variety of majors to choose from. I also interviewed Dave Boomer who is a paramedic. He said that this major would prepare students for a career in the paramedic field if that is what they wanted to do.</p>

<p>The fourth project was the “Multimedia Remix Project”. I enjoyed this one a lot. For this project we had to make a video on a previous paper and then write a memo to Dr. Daniels describing the project.     The group I was in worked well together and we decided our topic would be the same as my “Cultural Analysis” paper. Our group divided up the work and we found a lot of interesting things about Photoshop in today’s society. We were able to interview people and get their opinion on whether Photoshopping people is a good thing or a bad thing. We also interviewed someone who goes to Michigan State and her major deals heavily in Photoshop. We had a variety of people which helped our point. Our point was that it is not necessary to alter the image of people in media. People have their own individual beauty that should be expressed, not disguised. We also showed some of the side effects of using these images. What we found was horrible. We found people with extreme eating disorders because they are “too fat” by societies standards. Some would workout excessively trying to be in shape, but not taking care of their bodies. Some went through extreme plastic surgery. One woman had surgery to look like Barbie and a man did the dame to look like Ken. It showed how extreme people could be when it comes to looking “beautiful” in society’s eyes.</p>
