		<p>The purpose of this video was to make the viewer aware of how hurtful people are towards people who are gay and how your actions affect others. It also brings up the awareness of suicide among people who are gay and that suicide is not the answer. The video does tell the viewer that it does get better.</p>
<p>This video uses attempts to achieve its purpose by using a real life example of how others affected a man that was gay. How people treated him made "Uncle Ronnie" feels alone. His father did not support him which made him feel alone. It ended up driving Uncle Ronnie to suicide. The author of the letter is very similar to Uncle Ronnie. He is gay, divorced with children, has a parent who doesn’t understand him, and feels alone. Unlike Uncle Ronnie, he is not driven to suicide. The author is hurt and angry that Uncle Ronnie to his life. He tells of all the pain that was left behind from what Uncle Ronnie did.</p>
<p>The structure of the video uses poetry, letter, and pathos to convey the message. The author recites a poem at the beginning that directly relates to the topic. It engages the viewer to what he has to say. By formatting his speech in the form of a letter, it gives the viewer a personal connection to focus on. Having him talk about his own uncle who was in the same situation as him uses pathos. It gives an emotional connection that means a lot to the author. All of his anger and pain are brought out while he is reading the letter. It shows the pain of how being treated differently for who you love.</p>
<p>This will help me revise my Lived Experience project by showing how to add emotion to convey my purpose.  By adding how you feel engages the viewer’s emotional response and helps them see your view.</p>

<p>The people targeted in this video are video gamers who are obsessed with video games. It makes fun of people who do nothing but play video games.</p>
<p>The social issue is people are too invested with video games. They are willing to give up their life to play games. These people are willing to give up everything to play the game. Nothing is more important than their gaming. People give up their careers to spend time gaming, they do not take care of their health, they give up on their social life outside of the game, etc.</p> 
<p>The video’s creators’ show that there are people out there who are willing to give up their lives for gaming. They use humor and extreme cases to get the point across, but it is true. There are people out there like this. It is humorous, but it does get the point across that there are risks to people who are too invested in gaming. They show the man with “no life” who is obese and doesn’t eat properly. They show that it is dangerous by showing how the kids become obese, get acne, get carpal tunnel from the game, and cannot take a break for anything. The kids give up there life for a game. They neglect their need for sleep and school as well. It shows all the other kids outside for recess, but they are in the computer lab busy playing the game. They are doing all of this just to beat another player.  They become addicted and once they beat the player who was killing everyone, they do not know what to do other than play the game.</p>

<p>The imagery of Detroit in the advertisement for the Chrysler 200 shows how strong the city is. It shows all of the buildings standing tall. It also uses the steel fist to show the strength of the city and how it isn’t what people believe. It also shows the beautiful side of the city as well. It shows the art work of sculptures around the city. The sculptures are white and gold and show the luxury side of Detroit. They show a woman figure skating in a park to help emphasize beauty. </p>
<p>By including Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself” the advertisement shows what good comes from the city. Eminem started off as a poor boy in Detroit and worked his way up into being a very successful rapper. He shows that beautiful things come from the city and how it cannot be compared to any other city in the United States. It shows how good things do come for Detroit. Using Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself” shows that if you lose yourself in the true beauty in the city, you can see past the ugly stories written about Detroit. </p>
<p>Using the slogan “Imported from Detroit” is using almost a humorous. Its showing that even though the car is coming from Detroit it is still luxury. Usually luxury cars are associated with car companies from overseas. Therefore, the standard luxury cars are imported. Chrysler is saying that people don’t need to import from other companies, they can use American car companies for luxury cars. </p>

<p>Our first project was our “Lived Experiences” paper. For this paper we had to talk about the major we want to go into at Michigan State and what technology has influenced us in that decision. You had to explain the technology and how it relates to the major you are in. We also had to talk about what we wanted to do as a career with that degree and what we were required to do in that career. My major is genomics and molecular genetics. With this major I want to work in a crime lab. I had to think of what technology influenced me to pick my major. This was hard for me to think of. I finally remembered doing a lab in A.P. biology. In that lab we had to cut bacterial DNA and DNA sequence several different genomes and match the unknown DNA with a known. I remember loving DNA sequencing with gel electrophoresis. Working with the DNA showed me that I wanted to do that as a career. Before that lab, I wanted to do something in the medical field and I also loved the criminal justice field. I did not know the two could be connected, but that lab showed me they could. My dad was a huge inspiration for me. He was a cop in Florida and then decided he wanted to be a firefighter/ paramedic. He was in the criminal justice and medical profession. I wanted to be able to do both instead of choosing one like he did. This paper was a bit challenging, but also fun to learn more about your major.</p>

<p>The second project we did was the “Cultural Analysis” paper. We had to individually choose a problem in society and write about it. For me, this was hard. There are a lot of societal problems and I did not know which one to pick. I happened to go on yahoo and see an advertisement for some clothing company. The woman modeling was obviously Photoshopped. That was how I decided to write about the use of Photoshop in the media and how it affects society. I talked about how when you edit the appearance of someone, it is not them anymore it is a completely new and fake person. The models we see in the media do not actually look like the images produced. By editing these photos, it changes societies view on beauty and gives it a fake standard. It causes women to want to look like the models they see. Some women will do anything to look like the women they see in the media. It causes women to have eating disorders, participate in extreme exercise, and plastic surgery. They go through that to be what society has labeled as “beauty”.  Some men will do the same thing in order to be more “attractive” to women. It also gives both sexes a false reality on what the other should look like. It creates unrealistic standards. Once I got started on this paper, I found it got easier to write. It was not very hard to find images that had the “before and after” effects of Photoshop. My example was Jennifer Lawrence in GQ magazine. The before images were leaked on the web. It showed how much they changed her when she was beautiful without it. This project was fun and interesting to write about.</p>

<p>The third project we did was the “Formal Research” project. This project I struggled with a lot. Some of the problem was that I was traveling without internet because of rowing and the other was finding people to interview. I chose to do my project on the human biology discipline with the intention of perusing a degree in the medical field.  I found all the requirements for this major and researched the classes. I spent a lot of time researching this major. It was hard to find a lot of information done by the major, so I looked into information about career tracks taken by the major. Medical school and becoming a doctor was the main direction students with this degree went with. I looked into becoming a doctor and articles published by doctors that were interesting. I interviewed Dr. Hessler who teaches at Michigan State and he talked about how writing was an important part of being a doctor and how lucky students are in today’s society that they have a variety of majors to choose from. I also interviewed Dave Boomer who is a paramedic. He said that this major would prepare students for a career in the paramedic field if that is what they wanted to do.</p>

<p>The fourth project was the “Multimedia Remix Project”. I enjoyed this one a lot. For this project we had to make a video on a previous paper and then write a memo to Dr. Daniels describing the project.     The group I was in worked well together and we decided our topic would be the same as my “Cultural Analysis” paper. Our group divided up the work and we found a lot of interesting things about Photoshop in today’s society. We were able to interview people and get their opinion on whether Photoshopping people is a good thing or a bad thing. We also interviewed someone who goes to Michigan State and her major deals heavily in Photoshop. We had a variety of people which helped our point. Our point was that it is not necessary to alter the image of people in media. People have their own individual beauty that should be expressed, not disguised. We also showed some of the side effects of using these images. What we found was horrible. We found people with extreme eating disorders because they are “too fat” by societies standards. Some would workout excessively trying to be in shape, but not taking care of their bodies. Some went through extreme plastic surgery. One woman had surgery to look like Barbie and a man did the dame to look like Ken. It showed how extreme people could be when it comes to looking “beautiful” in society’s eyes.</p>

<p>When we first brought up culture in class I found myself think what my culture was. For me it would be my immediate family and town/school. My immediate family consists of my father, mother and two younger brothers. I have learned manners, morals, etc. from them. For my family on holidays we go to my mother’s parents’ house. We don’t always celebrate holidays with my dad’s family. Some of it is the distance of my dad’s family, but holidays aren’t as important.  I come from a small town where everybody knows everybody. In town, it is very common to ask how other family members are doing. At school, if an event happened everyone knew what had happened in 30 minutes.</p>	
<p>I have learned a lot about other cultures sense arriving at State. A teammate of mine is from Northern Ireland has showed me the difference in our cultures. I never realized how big the feud was between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Their religion tells them what part of Ireland they are from. If you are a protestant, you are from Northern Ireland and Catholics are in Ireland. Some reside in the other country, but for the most part it is separated. She is very cautious about calling herself “Irish” because she resides in Northern Ireland, so she is technically from Britain. Religion is a big part of their culture as well. Their religion is so important it is on their passports. Here we don’t define people by religion so it is odd for me to realize that.</p>

<p>Today we watched a documentary in class. The main purpose of the documentary is to look at how healing has transformed over the decades and looking at the possibility of aliens pushing these advancements forward. Ancient Egyptians had alien help with complex medicine. They had complex medical devices that may have been given to them by Thoth, the god of wisdom. The documentary says that Thoth may have been an alien that gave the Egyptians the knowledge of medicine. Oldest surgeon from ancient India and more advanced than anyone at the time. God that gave surgeon this knowledge had the ability to shape shift into a bird- like creature.  4,000 year old site had 14 skulls with holes in them. Early evidence of brain surgery that would be very risky even in today’s world. Ancient patients were having these surgeries and surviving. Inca skulls have been found with trepidation and many survived. One interesting part was that the healers avoided areas of brain that could have caused major damage. The healers had a lot of anatomy knowledge. Ica stones have been found with pre- Colombian history on them. These stones depicted people interacting with prehistoric creatures, maps, and surgeries such as: tracheotomy, C- section, and brain surgery. One stone shows a heart surgery taking place. Ancient Ireland has stories of a god of medicine coming down to help wounded soldiers. He was known for his advancements in medicine. A king lost arm in battle and god fitted him with a silver arm, like a prosthetic. Many told of a Greek god with ability to bring back the dead. He was the child of Apollo. His name in Greek means healing. He had the ability to bring the dead back to life. What happened to the knowledge? France 1283 AD: inquisition takes place. 500 years of bloody purge of what the Catholics think of as unholy. They tortured and killed people. Did they try to get rid of all interactions between us and aliens? The documentary showed that acupunctured survived and was developed before it was discovered in China. Bieon Kay from China was said to discover acupuncture. He was said to be half human/ half bird.

<p>Here is some stuff about me. I was going to post it in an earlier blog, but forgot too. The purpose of my project is to show people why I chose my major. I want to explain what technology made me choose my major and how it is used in my major/ career field. My major is genomics and molecular genetics.  With this degree I have to take classes about all the different aspects of genetics. I also have to learn about biochemistry and how that relates to genetics. Gel electrophoresis helped me choose what I wanted to do. It allows you to take DNA and run it through a gel. Once it is ran through the gel, the DNA shows up in bands which can be used to match DNA to other DNA ran through the gel. This is common in crime labs. I want to take my degree and work in a crime lab somewhere. My episode occurred in A.P. biology. I had no idea that criminology and science could work together, especially in the medical world. Doing the gel electrophoresis lab showed me how the two worked together. I knew that I wanted to work with DNA in a crime lab after that. This relates to my purpose because without this lab, I would have no idea what I wanted to do in life. I would still be confused and torn about my career path.</p>

<p>Here is an analysis of the remix project. The pictures and videos were the most beneficial to our research. The images are proof that this is occurring in magazines everywhere. The videos show how real the issue is. Showing how easy it is to completely change someone’s appearance and hearing from a person with an eating disorder makes the research that more real. The interviews helped the project but as far as research goes, they didn’t prove anything the photos and videos didn’t already accomplish. Our group worked really well together. There was something there for everybody to do and something everyone was good at. Working in a group was fruitful. It allowed us all to come together and all put a bit of our own taste into one video that really flowed well. The most affective aspect of our project would be the eating disorders part. It really brought up what people will do in order to look “beautiful”. It sends a strong message that images edited affect people in a negative way. It makes the issue real and shows the consequences of producing these images. We made our design decisions based on what made the video more dramatic to get the point across. We put it in order from altered images to the effects of these images to show how it is done before overwhelming the audience with the affects.</p>

<h1>Blog 12</h1>
<p>I really liked our remix project. I want to just say a little more about it. In today’s society Photoshop runs the imagery world. Most images that are posted have been altered in some way. Magazines and advertisements alter the image of people to make them “perfect” or “more attractive”. This is causing unrealistic standards of beauty. This standard is high for women than it is for men. This creates a variety of effects. Some of those effects cause women to turn towards unhealthy extremes to look like what society says is “beautiful” and it makes men think that women should look like the women in the magazines and advertisements. We interviewed Miranda McClellan, a student at Michigan State University, who is in a discipline that uses Photoshop. This is her opinion of using Photoshop on women.Photoshopping a person is a quick process if someone is familiar with Photoshop. It does not take long to manipulate the image of a person. Not many people see the unedited photos of celebrities or models; they only see the edited versions of the photos. By not seeing what people truly look like, young children and adults get unrealistic standards of what people should look like. People believe they should look like the people in magazines and advertisements because that is what society labels as “beautiful”. Some go through extreme measures to look like the people they see. Eating disorders, plastic surgery, and extreme exercise are some of the ways that people try and make themselves look like the images they see. This is more prevalent in women than in men, but some men do go to extremes to change their appearance.</p>

<h1>Blog 13</h1>
<p>I just remembered more I wanted to say about the remix project. I apologize for posting about it so much! The main conflict in this documentary is what magazines perceive women to look like. Magazines edit women to look smaller, so society expects women to look that way. The images they produce are not “real” women. Editing an image makes the women fake, because that is not what they truly look like. Women do not feel comfortable with their body shape and size because of the photos produced which causes them to go to extremes to look like the women in the magazines. Men believe women should look like the models, when really the models do not really look that way. The magazine companies will argue that they are just making the women look desirable by editing the pictures. This documentary will look at how society views magazine photos versus how people editing the photos view the photos. The main point would be to show the negative effects of Photoshop in society. The biases that could be brought up in this documentary could come from both conflicting sides. People viewing the picture could be angry at the editing because it does not look like them making them self-conscience and angry more at themselves than the photo, but they would express their anger at the magazine. The magazine would argue that it should not matter what the women look like, but the product they are advertising. They would also argue that society wants to see skinny women. </p>

<p>Since I went back to the remix project so much, I decided to reflect more on my formal research paper. The purpose of the formal research paper is to go into the human biology major with the prospect of going to medical school. It touched on the background of the major and the requirements needed to graduate with this degree. Communication in this discipline is done through writing scientific papers or articles referring to current human health problems. Technology is a very important factor in this major. A major component is learning how to use medical equipment that will be of use when continuing on to high education. Research is a major topic in this major. All students are required to do research in this field as part of a capstone experience. This ensures the students know how to conduct research and help the advancement in science at the same time. Human biology is a growing academic discipline. This discipline prepares students for a variety of career options in the medical field. Many students choose human biology to prepare them for medical school. In both human biology and medical school research is required. The goal of this research is to promote economic growth and help solve life issues. One topic that is creating research projects around the world is cancer research. Creating a cure for cancer would be the largest medical breakthrough so far in history. This would save millions of lives and help stimulate the economy. It would stimulate the economy by being able to have more consumers which create more demand on products, thus stimulating economy. It would also save many family members. People would not have to watch their loved ones suffer and pass away tragically, which is a very relevant life issue.</p>

<p>I though I would end with more about me and reflect on the lived project. I wasn’t the child who grew up knowing exactly what they wanted to be when they grew up. The only thing I was sure of was that I wanted to help people. As I got older, I knew I wanted to go into the medical field in some way. As much as I wanted to go into the medical field, I also wanted to do something in the criminal justice field. There was no better way to help people then by having a job that combines the medical and justice systems. My father is a paramedic and that is how my love for medicine started. Knowing he was saving people’s lives was an amazing concept to me as a young child. Before my father was a paramedic, he was a police officer. Hearing his stories from when he was a cop always made me want to do something in the criminal justice field, without being on the streets. I did not believe the two could be combined into one career, seeing as my father had to choose one or the other. My love for medicine outweighed my love for criminal justice and I gave up on finding a career that combined the two. Knowing this led me to take A.P. biology my senior year of high school. This class showed me that I could have a career in both careers and that it was possible to find a career that you love.</p>
