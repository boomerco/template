28      -    <p>&copy; The purpose of this video was to make the viewer aware of how hurtful people are towards people who are gay and how your actions affect others. This video uses attemps to achieve its purpose by using a real life example of how others affected a man that was gay. How people treated him made "Uncle Ronnie" feel alone. His father did  not support ohim which made him feel alone. It ended up driving him to suicide. The author of the letter happened to be in a similar situation. It uses an pathos to convey the message. This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences by adding more emotion to convey my purpose. Using pathos will make the reader become emtionally invested in my purpose. 0</p>
