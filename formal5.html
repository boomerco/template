			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is important in any discipline. It is especially important to those in the human biology major with a pursuit to attend medical school. The technology used prepares them for careers beyond college. These pieces of technology can range from an EKG to a heart rate monitor to a life support machine. Technology is very important in human biology. Another career pathway a degree in human biology can help with is being  a paramedic. Being a paramedic is a very stressful job. They are being called to the scene of an emergency and have to make life saving decisions. They need to be able to use any kind of technology needed in the back of an ambulance. An interview with David Boomer, a Captain at Delta Fire station, explained the importance of technology when on a call. He said, “You need to be able to size up a situation and be able to figure out what is going on in the emergency. You need to be able to know what is wrong with the human body and what you need to fix the problem or delay it as long as possible. Knowing what technology is needed and when to use it is very important. It means the difference between life and death.” Knowing how to use technology and when to use it is important in this discipline. It could mean life or death in a future career.</p>
