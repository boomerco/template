			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>By having magazines only use Photoshop for backgrounds or subtle changes, such as brightening the photo or adding a background, it would allow the true beauty of women to be exposed. Cutting back on the photo editing would create a more natural view of women. It would allow women to feel good about having “curves” and not looking like every other woman out there. Men would be able to see and appreciate how beautiful women truly are, not what the media has them believe women look like. This would also boost the self-esteem of women. Women would be more comfortable with being themselves and not what others want to look like. They would see the true beauty in other women along with themselves. 
At first, the idea might be rejected. People would be confused and the models would be outraged. Models are used to being depicted as perfect, but not editing the pictures would give them a natural look. The idea would catch on. Women would embrace their imperfections and turn them into perfections. Slowly society would see how wrong it was to change the beauty of women. Women would gain confidence they never had before and men would realize that no one woman is perfect. Everyone would see the way women are truly supposed to look.
