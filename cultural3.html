			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The best example of this is from the magazine GQ. In one edition of GQ, the magazine Photoshopped Jennifer Lawrence in a white swim suit to make her smaller. It was not known until photos taken from the shoot were released. The original photo shows how the magazine had edited the picture to make Lawrence appear to have slimmer arms, legs, hips, and waist than she really does. They made her stomach flat and made the edges of her face more defined. By editing her photos, they created an unrealistic version of a movie star. Nothing about the edited photos was really her. The same thing was done to a picture of her used for the front cover of the magazine Flare. Taking a beautiful, young actress and manipulating her image makes other young females want to look like her. Seeing the printed images makes them want to look like her. Little do people know that it really is not Jennifer Lawrence. Young women want to look like famous women because they believe men will be more attracted to them. Men seeing the beautiful women in magazines make them want women who look like that. This has been done to countless magazine covers and articles. They make women to appear what they think men want not what men actually see. </p>
