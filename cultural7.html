			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Society views women as objects that should be perfect, but reality is that women are not perfect. Perfection comes from the ideas that magazines create by using Photoshop to create unrealistic views on women and their body size. Magazines portray women as small and weak objects. They make women skinny and accentuate their features to create a more appealing look. By changing their appearance, it gives an unrealistic standard to what women should look like. Women crave to look like their idols, but even their idols do not actually look like that. It makes women try outrageous things to try and be as small as their idol. It is very unhealthy and could ultimately cause death. Men see women in magazines and believe every woman should look like that. Truth is, no one is perfect. Women should accept and embrace the way they look. Jennifer Lawrenceâ€™s photos in GQ show how fake magazine women are. </p>
