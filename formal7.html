			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Human biology has many options in career fields. However, most students go into this discipline to go into the medical school. This degree has challenging classes that focus of all areas of science and prepare students for many careers outside of college. It prepares students to further their education into a field that truly interests them like becoming a doctor or even a paramedic. The options are endless in the health field when it comes to a degree in human biology. Communication is used in not only research, but in medical offices to convey patient information from one doctor to the next. Technology is used in so many ways in this discipline. It depends on what a student wants to go into as a career. As David Boomer mentioned, it is very important to know how to use the technology needed in the career students go into because it could end up saving a life. Research is the most important of all. Students need to know how to be able to conduct research as well as present their data. Using tables and/or charts, students use a visual component to their research. It shows that they can use statistics and other measurable variables in research. Dr. Hessler also said, “…students these days are very lucky. They have the opportunity to get degrees that I could have never imagined. When I went to school it was engineering, biological science, or some broad topic. Today, students can specialize in a degree that can help them with more jobs. Human biology is a great major way for students who plan to go to medical school and if they do not, then there are so many other possibilities.    </p>
