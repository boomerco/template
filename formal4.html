			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Communication is very important to this major and career field. It is especially important in research. The data that is collected needs to be presented in a way for the audience to understand it. In this career path the audience varies on what is being written. If a scholarly article is being written on cancer research, then the data must be presented in a clear and concise way. The audience would be other medical professionals that are interested in the same research. The vocabulary used would be that used in the medical field. It would be written for other doctors and professionals to understand it, but maybe not written for the average American could understand it. The terminology would be complex, therefore, not understood among most of the American population. An example of this would be an article on the Human Gastric Carcinogenesis:  A Multistep and Multifactorial Process—First American Cancer Society Award Lecture on Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention.  This article talks about how in the initial stages of cancer, when atrophy begins, excessive salt intake is very common along with being infected with Helicobacter pylori and it continues on to talk about later stages of cancer along with cancer prevention. This article would be helpful in research or in analysis of cancer research. This article was published in 1992 at the 83rd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that took place in San Diego, California. The terminology is extremely difficult for anyone who has not been introduced or exposed to the language before. Students in human biology would be able to read and comprehend it because they have to take classes in cancer and cancer research. This article shows the complexity of medical articles. Other medical articles can be much easier to understand. Trade publications are still written by professionals, but are easier to understand to the general public. It still contains medical terminology but the context is easier to understand. One article from Dr. Oz called “Flatten Your Stomach by Eating More Fat” is a professional study done by doctors, but released more for the public. It uses much easier terminology to understand, but it is still correct. It makes it easier for other non- medical professionals to understand it clearly. This article talks about a study conducted in Sweden at Uppsala University. In this study, saturated fats were found to increase fat in the human body around the liver and abdominal region. Polyunsaturated fats do the opposite. It was proven that they actually increase muscle mass. The foods we eat have these fats in them and the article talks about how eating certain foods with the polyunsaturated fats can help people lose weight. The language used in this article is much easier for the average American to understand. It conveys meaning and a study done and it is not very confusing. An interview done with Dr. Hessler who is also a professor at Michigan State was asked why writing is important to the medical field. He said, “It is a big question. A lot is used in communication. Everything is based on studies already done and those have to be written down. The data must be published and everything must be precise when presenting data. Another big part is what is done in a day. We have to document everything done in every day. How and why you made that decision you made and what is exactly wrong with a patient. We also have to write letters to other doctors about patients. Most of us are criticized because legibility is not very good, but you have to write so much that it starts to become not legible. Sometimes you look back and say, “Wow, did I write that?” because the writing looks so foreign. This is becoming less common due to electronic files, email, and other technological advances.” Sharing this insight on the medical field helps show the communication needed in everyday life for people wanting to go into medicine. Human biology majors have to understand the communication that is required to be in this major.</p>
