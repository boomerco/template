			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the cultural analysis paper is to expose how society changes the look of women, by using Photoshop to create unrealistic standards of women. GQ, a popular magazine, had a photo shoot with Jennifer Lawrence. Before publishing the magazine, they photoshopped her pictures to make her smaller and more defined than she truly is.  The problem this creates is an unrealistic standard that women should be skinny and always look appealing to men. It causes women to become worried about weight and beauty when the women they see on magazines are not actually real. It causes men to look at women as sexual objects and makes them perceive that women should be small and always wear makeup. This “standard” creates a multitude of problems in society. People turn to eating disorders, plastic surgery, etc. to be perfect for society, not themselves. A solution would be to stop using Photoshop to “re-make” women.  </p>
