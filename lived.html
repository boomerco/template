		<h1>My Career Path</h1>
		<p>I wasn’t the child who grew up knowing exactly what they wanted to be when they grew up. The only thing I was sure of was that I wanted to help people. As I got older, I knew I wanted to go into the medical field in some way. As much as I wanted to go into the medical field, I also wanted to do something in the criminal justice field. There was no better way to help people then by having a job that combines the medical and justice systems. I did not believe the two could be combined into one career. My love for medicine outweighed my love for criminal justice and I gave up on finding a career that combined the two. Knowing this led me to take A.P. biology my senior year of high school. This class showed me that I could have a career in both medicine and criminal justice.</p>
		<p>My major at Michigan State University is genomics and molecular genetics. With this degree there are so many options. With this degree I have to take classes about all the different aspects of genetics. I also have to learn about biochemistry and how that relates to genetics. I can choose what path I want to go on. There are classes that help prepare you for certain jobs. Virology and immunology are classes you can choose to take for someone who wants to work in a research lab creating vaccines against different viruses and pathogens. Plant genetics would help with create better crops or help find cures to plant diseases. Animal genetics would help with prepare you for a variety of jobs dealing with animal DNA. Mapping genomes of species is a popular study right now. I am interested in the human genetics aspect. Human genetics would prepare me for a variety of careers. Some of the career options are research, criminology, genetic mapping, etc. I am interested in the criminology aspects. I want to start with my bachelor’s degree in genomics and molecular genetics and get a job with a crime lab. In the crime lab I would extract DNA from items from a crime scene and process it. I eventually want to go back to school and get my masters or doctorate in forensic sciences. With that degree I would like to work in a crime lab for the FBI. There I would help find criminals through tracing their DNA. This career has both the medical and criminal justice components I have always wanted. The genetics satisfies my love for medicine and the forensics satisfies my love for criminal justice.</p>
		<p>How did A.P. biology get me to the track I am on? It was through a simple lab. One lab made me realize what I wanted to do. In this lab we used gel electrophoresis. The gel is poured into a specialized square container and put into the fridge to set up. Once the gel has settled into a solid form, DNA is injected into small wells that were created by the container. The square dish is placed into a large box full of water and salts with electrodes connected to the outside lid of the box. These charges create an electric field within the box. The positive and negative charges cause the different particles in DNA to separate by size through the gel. The particles in DNA will be attracted to one charge more than the other which also causes the DNA to separate. Once completed, the gel is removed and the DNA particles can be observed in bands of different sizes and shapes. Each band has DNA of the same size in the band. The bands can be used to match different samples of DNA. The pattern created by the bands of DNA is unique to the DNA taken which is why the gels can be compared to see if the DNA matches. The bands are specific to the DNA sample. If someone has a DNA sample it can be matched to another DNA sample by comparing the two gels. If all of the bands match, then the DNA samples are a match. If one band is different in any way, then the DNA samples are not a match. This technology opened up a new door for me. I knew I wanted to work with this again. Our job was to test four bacteria DNA samples and had one unknown DNA sample that matched one of the other four samples. The lab had to be run and then the bands had to be compared. Whatever strand matched the unknown had the same DNA. Running this lab was challenging, but I loved every moment of it. I knew that I wanted to work with gel electrophoresis again. </p>
		<p>had gone home and looked up all the possible jobs that dealt with electrophoresis.  As I was researching I found that electrophoresis and similar experiments are used in crime labs. Any DNA found at a crime scene has to be processed. One way to process it is through electrophoresis. Once the DNA is extracted from the source it can be ran through the electrophoresis. Once it has been run, the DNA can be compared to other DNA that has also been run. By carefully comparing the samples, you can find linking DNA. If DNA at one crime scene matches the DNA of anther scene then the same person is involved with both crimes. This would be used in the FBI to track and trace serial criminals through the United States. By helping sort through the DNA, I could help find serial criminals and aide in bringing them to justice. It can also clear suspects of involvement. If the DNA does not math, then the person would not have committed the crime. By clearing the suspect of involvement, the police can go back to focusing on finding the person who committed the crime. Gel electrophoresis does not give characteristics about what the DNA was taken from. For example, the DNA at a crime scene was brought to the lab and was run through gel electrophoresis. From the sample it would not tell if a man or a woman or what he/she look like.  It just gives the DNA pattern for whatever is being tested. Gel electrophoresis is a great way to run DNA and find the DNA pattern of a person. This process is not complicated once it is learned and yields great results. This piece of technology has helped me pick what I want to do with my life as well as bring many criminals to justice. It has helped created a career that I want to pursue. This career has both the medical and criminal justice aspect I was looking for. This is the best way for me to help people, which has always been what I truly wanted to do. I now have a career path that satisfies all of my criteria. This is the path I have dreamed of and now I have a plan and a major that will make me successful in life and I will be in the career I love.</p>
