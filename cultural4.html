			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The issue with this is women are doing outrageous things to look like their role models. Some women turn to eating disorders. These disorders cause women to lose a significant amount of weight and are very dangerous. Eating disorders cause the body to break down and “eat” itself. This ultimately leads to death. Some women turn to plastic surgery to become smaller. Plastic surgery is dangerous and can have severe consequences. Any surgery can have complications, so why have surgery when it can be avoided?  It can cause death if not performed correctly and very expensive. Women will get lipo-suction or breast implants to feel more attractive. They believe that if they look like women in the magazines they read then men will be more attracted to them. It also makes men think women should look like the magazine photos. They think that normal women should be small and petite with lots of makeup. This is what they see and believe is true. Men and women do not understand that the photos are not real. They were altered, which makes the women in them fake. The model may have posed, but changing her body makes it not her anymore.</p>
	<p>I feel that magazines should not edit women this way. Seeing women in this way is falsifying what women truly look like. It gives a false standard to young women to try and be something that is not real. It creates health issues when young women want to be as skinny as their favorite actress. They are willing to try extreme diets and eating disorders. They are willing to get plastic surgery in order to be “more attractive”.  In return men think it is normal to have women that are smaller, when it is not true. Men use these images to create the “perfect women” in their mind. The “perfect women” does not actually exist. Women cannot live up to that role and then feel inferior and “ugly” when they are not.
