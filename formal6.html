			<p>Research in this discipline is very important. Students must complete research to graduate with a degree in human biology. Even after graduation, research is a key element to this field of study. Residencies and internships require research and job experience that is needed to be hired in the work place. Research is needed no matter what career students decide to pursue. Research is important to the medical world. One wrong answer or number and it could ruin the entire experiment. Charts and graphs are especially important to research. It is an easy way to display data without writing a huge article on what can be represented in a picture. Written information must be included, but a graph is an easier way for the audience to comprehend the data provided. The graph below is an example of data collected about cancer rates. 
Using charts like this, students can convey research in a graphic way that is easier for the audience to comprehend. Research is a major component to Human biology. Most of a studentâ€™s junior and senior year is used to participate in research. Partaking in interesting research that is a current social issue can help students get jobs in research, if that is what the student wants to do.
