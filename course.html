		<h1>Course Retrospect</h1>
		<p>In this class we have done four different projects. Each project has had a different style of writing, which has broadened my writing skills. With these projects we were asked different questions and all of them were related back to science and technology in some way. When I registered for this class, I thought it was going to be like every other writing class I had heard about on campus. I was very surprised on the first day when it was not. We were told about the projects, which all had writing components, but there were so many other tasks. We had to learn how to code, write blogs, use video software, etc.  All of these things have challenged me and my writing skills. It has also given me a different outlook on writing styles.</p>
		<p>Our first project was our “Lived Experiences” paper. For this paper, we had to talk about the major or discipline we want to go into at Michigan State University and what technology has influenced us in that decision. You had to explain the technology that influenced you in your decision and how it relates to the major you are in. We also had to talk about what we wanted to do as a career with that degree. We had to also write about what we were required to do in that career. My major at Michigan State is genomics and molecular genetics. With this major, I want to work in a crime lab sequencing DNA from criminals. My dream would be to work in the forensic lab of the FBI. I had to think of what technology influenced me to pick my major. This was hard for me to think of. I could not remember a piece of technology that had influenced me. I finally remembered doing a lab in A.P. biology my senior year of high school. In that lab we had to cut bacterial DNA and then sequence the DNA of several different genomes. The point of the lab was to match the unknown or unlabeled DNA with a known. I remember loving DNA sequencing with gel electrophoresis. Working with the DNA showed me that I wanted to do that as a career. Before that lab, I wanted to do something in the medical field and I also loved the criminal justice field. I did not know the two could be connected, but that lab showed me they could. My dad was a huge inspiration for me while growing up. He was a cop in Florida and then decided he wanted to be a firefighter/ paramedic. He was in the criminal justice and medical profession. I wanted to be able to do both instead of choosing one like he did. This paper was a bit challenging, but also fun to learn more about your major. A helpful tip would be to find an emotional connection to something in your paper more than your major.</p>
		<p>The second project we did was the “Cultural Analysis” paper. We had to individually choose a problem in society and write about it. For me, this was hard. There are a lot of societal problems and I did not know which one to pick. I happened to go on yahoo and see an advertisement for a clothing company. The woman modeling was obviously Photoshopped to look smaller and fix blemishes she had. That was how I decided to write about the use of Photoshop in the media and how it affects society. I talked about how when you edit the appearance of someone, it is not them anymore it is a completely new and fake person. The models we see in the media do not actually look like the images produced. By editing these photos, it changes societies view on beauty and gives it a fake standard. It causes women to want to look like the models they see, when in reality the models themselves do not look like that. Some women will do anything to look like the women they see in the media. It causes women to have eating disorders, participate in extreme exercise, and undergo plastic surgery. They go through some or all of these things to be what society has labeled as “beauty”.  Even men will go through the extremes in order to be more “attractive” to women, or feel more confident in their appearance. It also gives both sexes a false reality on what the other should look like. It creates unrealistic standards that both sexes cannot live up to. Once I got started on this paper, I found it got easier to write. It was not very hard to find images that had the “before and after” effects of Photoshop. My example was Jennifer Lawrence in GQ magazine. The before images were leaked on the internet. It showed how much they changed her when she was beautiful without being edited. This project was fun and interesting to write about. Going through current events is a great way to find a topic to write on. Once a topic interests you, research it and see if you are able to write about it.</p>
		<p>The third project we did was the “Formal Research” project. This project I struggled with a lot. Some of the problem was that I was traveling without internet because of rowing and the other was finding people to interview. I chose to do my project on the human biology discipline with the intention of pursuing a degree in the medical field.  I found all the requirements for this major and researched the classes needed to graduate with this degree. I spent a lot of time researching this major. It was hard to find a lot of information done by the major, so I looked into information about career tracks taken by the major. Medical school and becoming a doctor was the main direction students with this degree went with. I looked into becoming a doctor and articles published by doctors that were interesting. I found that the classes that human biology majors take set the students up to do well in medical school. I interviewed Dr. Hessler who is a professor at Michigan State University and he talked about how writing was an important part of being a doctor and how lucky students are in today’s society that they have a variety of majors to choose from. He also explained how writing is used every day by doctors and it is very important to that career. I also interviewed Dave Boomer who is a paramedic. He said that this major would prepare students for a career in the paramedic field if that is what they wanted to do. Writing is also very important for this career. After every medical call, the paramedics who responded to the call have to write what happened and how they treated the patient. For this paper, find an interesting major that you can find enough information to write on and find people to interview.</p>
		<p>The fourth project was the “Multimedia Remix Project”. I enjoyed this project a lot. For this project, we were divided into assigned groups that had to make a video on a previous paper and then write a memo to Dr. Daniels describing the project. The group I was in worked well together and we decided our topic would be the same as my “Cultural Analysis” paper. Our group divided up the work and we found a lot of interesting things about Photoshop in today’s society. We were able to interview people and get their opinion on whether Photoshopping a person is a good thing or a bad thing. We also interviewed someone who goes to Michigan State and her major deals heavily in Photoshop. We had a variety of people which helped our point. Our point was that it is not necessary to alter the image of people in media. People have their own individual beauty that should be expressed, not disguised. We also showed some of the side effects of using these images. What we found was horrible. We found people with extreme eating disorders because they are “too fat” by societies standards. Some would workout excessively trying to be in shape, but not taking care of their bodies. Some went through extreme plastic surgery. One woman had surgery to look like Barbie and a man did the dame to look like Ken. It showed how extreme people could be when it comes to looking “beautiful” in society’s eyes.</p>
		<p>During the semester we also had a project on http://www.codecademy.com/dashboard. This teaches you how to computer code. The most important part of this project is not to wait until the last minute to start it. It is a pretty simple program to use. Once you learn to use it, it makes class easier. Learning to code will help you understand what the class is based around. When you go to turn an assignment, you will know what you are doing. As you go along in codecademy, it is fun to play around with the lay out of your profile. Changing your profile is required, but changing it while you are learning it makes it easier. </p>
